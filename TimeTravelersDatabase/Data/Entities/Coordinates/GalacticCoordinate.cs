	/// Galactic coordinates are a system that lets us know where 
	/// the Earth is in the solar system at a particular time and date. 
	/// 
	/// The Earth moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and know where it 
	/// is around once in a while, you could miss it.
	/// 
	/// This is important to time travelers as they may want to land 
	/// on the location of the Earth in the global coordinates provided 
	/// rather than where the Earth is at the time of departure.
