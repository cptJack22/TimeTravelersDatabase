# The Time Traveler's Database
This is a coding project to use and learn modern programming frameworks to create a simple list of time and points in space where it has been deemed safe for time traveler arrival.

## Introduction ##

Imagine you are a time traveller and you want to go to the past. How would you know when/where it is safe? There's no reason you shouldn't have that information available. It is the past after all. We've already been there.

Enter the Timetraveler's Database. A simple list of time and points in space where it has been deemed safe for arrival. Any timetraveler who uses this resource will have to trust that the location isn't actually in a volcanoe or the bottom of the ocean or simpley a point in space far from habitable terrain. While tricking timetravelers isn't the goal of this database, I can't recommend arriving on April 1st of any year.

A bonus for the person recording safe arrival windows is that they will be there when it is used. Imagine being the first person to greet a timetraveler! That is payment enough. This project doesn't have enough funding to cover the cost of paying Time Marshallers.

## Stephen Hawking's Time Traveler Champagne  Party ##

Stephen Hawking famously threw a time traveler's champagne party on June 28, 2009. Invitations were sent out a day _after_ the event took place. No one showed up. What if they just couldn't find safe landing coordinates? This application intends to supply safe arrival windows.

## Things a Timetraveler might want to know ##

- clear arrival location on Earth
- size of cleared area
- time
- Earth's location in the solar system. We're a fast-moving target.
- Population (are there people around? how many?)
- Weather. An answer to the question, "how should one dress?"
- National News headlines (does one even _want_ to come here?)
- Current photos (to provide visual confirmation of a correct arrival)
- Used? Once used, the arrival window should be removed to prevent unfortunate incidents)

## Time Marshallers ##

Just like at an airport, a safe arrival requires a marshaller. A Time Marshaller clears an arrival window and will likely be the first contact a timetraveler makes. A Time Marshaller should be prepared for this honor. It is required that a Time Marshaller carries with them the welcome speech. (see the first Futurama episode)

### Time Marshaller Kit ###

- Welcome speech. At this time, each time marshaller is responsible for their own welcome speech/presentation. Ideas may be taken from popular media. "Futurama" and "Back to the Future" are some examples.
- Traffic cones and "caution" or "do not enter" tape to mark off the arrival area. 
- Sunglasses. Since we have not yet had a successful arrival, we do not know if there is a blinding light associated with timetravel, so even at night, it's a good idea to keep a pair of sunglasses handy.
- Geiger counter. Optional. Again, we don't know much about timetravel. The assumption is that timetravelers would not want to cause undue harm upon arrival, but that is only an assumption.
- Pen and paper. There are many uses for pen and paper beyond paper airplanes and pointing at where the airplanes have headed.
- Towel. We don't argue with the logic of Douglas Adams.
- GPS unit. Global coordinates are very important to creating an appropriate and safe arrival window.
- First aid kit. It's never a bad idea to have one. Antibiotics and sanitizers are recommended inclusions.
- Toothbrushes. How many times have you arrived at your destination and realized you forgot your toothbrush. It's maddening and we're here to help timetravelers.
- Whistle. Timetravel may be loud and a time mashaller may need to get the attention of bystanders getting too close to the arrival window.
